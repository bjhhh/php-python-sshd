# MariaDB database server configuration file.
# docker mariadb服务容器 my.cnf配置调优，暂时针对1-2g内存的低配置服务器
# You can copy this file to one of:
# - "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" to set global options,
# - "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
# 
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.
#
# For explanations see
